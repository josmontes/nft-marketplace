# NFT Marketplace with NextJS & Solidity
This is a simple project to improve my nextjs, web3 & solidity skills. The user may upload an nft, list it and be able to buy it with another account. 

## Getting Started
- Modify `.env` files `keys.json`
- Use `truffle-cli` to load the contract with `truffle migrate`.
- Install all dependencies with `npm install`.
- Run dev environment with `npm run dev`.
